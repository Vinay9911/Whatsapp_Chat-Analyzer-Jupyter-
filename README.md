# 📊 WhatsApp Chat Analyzer

I deployed a robust Streamlit application designed to allow users to upload WhatsApp chat files for detailed analysis. The application automatically generates a comprehensive report that provides deep insights into user interactions. It includes dynamic visualizations such as 📅 heatmaps for identifying peak messaging times, 🌥️ word clouds to highlight frequently used terms,amy many more such visualization. Beyond these, the platform is equipped with advanced features like 🕵️‍♂️ criminal pattern analysis using NLP techniques to detect suspicious activity, 🔗 link extraction to gather URLs shared in the conversations, 😊 sentiment analysis to gauge emotional tones, and 🗺️ detection of suspicious keywords. These capabilities make it a powerful tool for both casual users and those needing detailed investigative reports.
